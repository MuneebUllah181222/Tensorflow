# tensorflow-practice
This repository contains Python files based on the TensorFlow library, which I created as part of my learning journey. These files cover various concepts and techniques related to deep learning, such as:
* Batch Normalization
* Callbacks
* Early Stopping
* Regularization
* Weights Initialization
* Using Pre-trained models

## Getting Started
To use the files in this repository, you'll need to have the following libraries installed on your machine. You can install these using pip:
```
pip install tensorflow
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
```
Once you have installed all the libraries, simply clone this repository to your local machine and run the Python files using a Python interpreter.

## Contributing
